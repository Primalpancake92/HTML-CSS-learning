This is a short guide or foundation to picking up HTML - CSS. It contains information on introductory and fundamental topics, such as declarative tags, and its properties, to the individual values and what style this may imply.
It is great for people to freely use while I also learn the marketup language and stylesheet. Please enjoy this learning journey with me.
